These files are Power BI dashboards that explore and visualize political trends and ideas through the collection of historical data and Pew surveys.

The project on sentiment analysis post-2020 election. What was most interesting in understanding the motivation for voters, both for why they voted in the 2020 presidentail election
as well as how they felt approximately one month after the election, was that Trump voters were more motivated by positive feeling toward Trump while a majority of Biden voters were
motivated by negative feelings toward Trump. One the interesting takeaways from this, especially sitting here in 2021 after we have seen several special elections favor Republicans
is that without Trump on the ballot or in political office, has dampened Democrat turn out without having as significant an impact on Republical turn out. 

Political-Representation
Understanding the differences in political representations by visualizing state population vs federal representation and demonstrating the effect it has on national politics.
This is an ongoing project that is still in development. The visualizations draw on census and historic data on population and federal representation in both the Senate and Congress.
My interest here is to understand how differences in Sentate and Congressional representations skew the power of individuals in different states. 
For example, all states have two senators, regardless of population. So California, with almost 40 million people, has the same number of senators as Wyoming which just over  
500,000 people. This means that Wyoming has one senator for about every 250,000 people, while California has one senator for every 15,000,000. That means that each 
person in Wyoming has 60x more representation in the Senate than each person in California. Such a discrepenecy affects all people in larger states, such as Texas, just not 
at the extreme of what we see with California. 
It is also interesting to compare proportional represenation in the House of Representatives since the number of Representatives in the House changes based on population.
What we see in the visualizations that compare House representation with population is that there are still discepencies in representations but these discepenecies are
far smaller than what we see in the Senate. 

I am currently working on comparing the current discepencies with the system as first established following the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. There are 
several key assumptions I have made to help fill in gaps and smooth out issues. First, not all the states adopted the Consitution (i.e., became states) right away.
Main, for example, didn't become a state with federal representation until 1820! Also, the fact that representation was based on total population (that is all people) while
the right to vote was generally only given to white, land-owning men. This creates significant propblems for a project looking at disenfranchisement since states with significant
population of non-white, non-landowning people will have high federal representation but do not actually represent the will of those people who do not play an active role in
electing those officials. Also, senators were not chosen by direct elections at this time.

At a time when the the fillibuster and the breakdown of bipartisan legislation has made any action in the Senate nearly impossible, it is helpful to look to the House to see that 
a more accurate representation of the will of the population allows for more work to be accomplished.
